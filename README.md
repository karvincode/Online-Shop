# Online-Shop
Backend And Frontend of an Online Shop
I removed the password change request support because I got too many spam emails and it was annoying talking to there support team.

Instructions to run locally:
1. Run the frontend via npm run dev
2. Run the backend in the node-js-express-login-example-master folder and in that folder via node server.js
